First, we need to add the passwords to the MasterExamDates tab;e
Run AddPaswords.aspx

Once the Passwords have been entered, you can generate the Reports for the setup team.
BUT sometimes the proctoredExamDates table is missing data for new or pilot courses;

So before generating any reportsl. please run this sql query to find courses wiith missing date and password data

use VC_VCData
select distinct course from MasterProctor where term = '2213'
and masterproctor.course not in (select distinct course from MasterExamDates where term = '2213')

This guarantees that we have exam date and password data for all courses in the MasterProctor table.

The problem with ProctorU is that they need a record for each course, but the MasterProctor table goes by Families of multiple courses.
So we need to create a new set of records for each child course that has the same settings as the parent course. 
  Sometimes we find null db values in the MasterProctor Table after faculty have provided input. To prevent nulls from throwing errors when you run the reports, please
  There may have been apostrophes added by faculty in the mid or final notes entryl Those unhandled apostrophies caused a sql fail and we had missing info.
   I changed the sql in the editing page to [MidNotes] = Replace(@MidNotes, '''', '') Note: must use double single quotes in the find variable to to get sql to recognize command
   Replace(variable, single single single single comma single single)
To do that we run the InputProctorTesting DB.aspx
