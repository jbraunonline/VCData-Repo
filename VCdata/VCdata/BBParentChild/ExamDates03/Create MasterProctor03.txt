Get the distinct parents from bb+ParentChild03

SELECT Distinct Parent, course
  FROM [VC_VCData].[dbo].[BB_ParentChild03]

Then with that, create parent, familystring, course and put that into MasterProctor03

Dim mycourse  dr(course)
Myparent  dr(Parent)
dim mychidren as string

select childref from bb_parentChild where parent = myparent
loop thorugh the records and create childref1 + childref2 etc.

Myfamily = myparent + mychildren

Now update masterproctor
insert   myfamily, myparent, mycourse

now move all the courses in bb (by term) where ischild = 0 and ref. not in (select distinct parent from BB_ParentChild03)

Use VC_VCData 
SELECT reference, course
  FROM [VC_VCData].[dbo].[BBcourses]
  where ischild = 0 and term_key='2203' and category <> 'Master' 
  and reference not in (Select distinct Parent from BB_ParentChild03)

  input that data into MasterProctor03    as  FamilyString, Parent


  Now that we have all courses in MasterProctor03
       add the course data
	   add the exam data
