Setting up Proctored Exam Testing Data (sessions a & A   for B see below)
Preliminary: 
....Make sure that the CMR is complete for the sessions being input for the term. ~/CMR/UploadCMR.aspx

....upload to masterexamdates from Ernest dates spreadsheet  ~/MasterExamDates/AddMasterExamDates.aspx
....Update the passwords in the table after getting password keys from Amy: ~/BBParentChild/AddMasterExamPasswords.aspx
....Copy te exan data frfrom the designer DB to the VC_VCollege DB.  Delete the existing table and recreate it from the VC_VCdata:

Select * into [VC_VCData].[dbo].[OL_MasterExam] from
[VC_VCData1].[dbo].[OL_MasterExam]
Where [VC_VCData1].[dbo].[OL_MasterExam].[Term]= '2205'       '''''DONE 5/27/2020

1....Start by getting (1&a session) lester's report of synched courses.
      then  ~/BBParentChild/UploadBB_ParentChild.aspx
2....input the data to BB_ParentCHild and Set Families  Don't forget to manually update thesessions in MasterProctor(sql on page)
Update dbo.MasterProctor 
set dbo.masterProctor.session=CMR.Session 
we rrun the above becasue there may be multiple sessions in the parent/child data and we need to set the recoreds to te correct session
3....Stop[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[

Go to /BBParentChild/resetBBcourse.aspx
delete BBCourses_BU and make a backup of BBCourses to BBcourses_BU ------- do this in sql mgment studio
This creates an emergency BU of BBCourses in case there is a failure in the next steps.
Resetting the bbcourses table is probably not necessary, but in insures that Wendy's dashboard is updated to what actually exists in BB>

	Reset the BB Data in case Wendy failed to correctly input parent/child relationships (follow directions on page)
	Then input the singletons for the session: either 1&a  or B-only

,4....]]]]]]]]]]] Return to ~/BBParentChild/UploadBB_ParentChild.aspx

     Add Course Data
     Add Exam Dates
     Add Exam Details
 5.... update the MasterProctor lockdown values (sql on page)

6...Backup MasterProctor to MasterProctor_BU for reference of default values when validating faculty input.

7;..Open up the Faculty Portal so faculty can review/modify exam settings.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\before moving on, correct for some nulls that may have come over from the designers

8...When settings have been reviewed and validated Telerik2/ ~/ProctorSettings/Reports/SpecialAttention.aspx  NOTE that the review pages are in the faculty portal not VCadmin update [VC_VCData].[dbo].[MasterProctor]   set PF_ANXMTR = ''   where  PF_ANXMTR is null;

  update [VC_VCData].[dbo].[MasterProctor]   set PF_ANXMTR = ''   where  PF_ANXMTR is null;
  
  update [VC_VCData].[dbo].[MasterProctor]   set PM_ANXMTR = ''   where  PM_ANXMTR is null;

  update [VC_VCData].[dbo].[MasterProctor]   set FinalNameR = ''   where  FinalNameR is null;
   After the values in the MasterProctor table have been verified  (mosly date switching and inaccurate dates from Burt's data)
]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]setting up for Proctor U....the difference between these two reports is that proctorU must have values for each course and the setup team only needs data for parent courses

9.  At this point you can generate the BBsetup team report to set up the eexams  ~/ExamSetupTeam/BlackboardSetupMidTerm.aspx (or Finals if all MasterProctor data verified)

10...you can move on to the ~/BBParentChild/InputProctorTestingDB.aspx to create the MasterProctorTesting data
       NOTE: this page generates date for two things. a. student exam windows (proctor/myproctor.aspx) and the data needed for testing centers and ProctorU.

	   This page works incrementally be session and exam. (if doing 1 and A, then this page needs to run FOUR times.
   Session + Mid + ExamSetup  (+GetPasswords)     Session+Mid+StudentDates  
   Session + Final + ExamSetup  (+GetPasswords)     Session+Final+StudentDates  
        The student dates run does NOT need to add passwords as students only see dates.
A. Select session1 Midterm and select Exam Setup. Preview (note the counts) If the counts are correct, RUN +  Copy Data
B. The Get Passwords link will give you the correct SQL to manually run and add the pwds to the MasterProctorTesting table.
C. Repeats step A, only now select Student Dates.  Verify sql goes too MasterProctorTesting_BU table. this is now complete (no pwds needed)

Now you can generate the reports for Testing Centers and ProctorU
~/ExamSetupTeam/ExamSetup.aspx  (For testing centers)
~/ProctorU/GetProctorU.aspx

.........................................................................................................................................................................................
***Session B***Session B***Session B***Session B***Session B***Session B***Session B***Session B***Session B

Get clearance from Donna that the B term is complete.
Update the CMR   ~/CMR/UploadCMR.aspx

We go through the same process for B as for sessions 1&A. Faculty can go to the faculty portal to review final Proctored Exam settings for B session.
To get the data ready for faculty verification, we start by
1..bACKUP  MasterProctor and BB_ParentChild to respective _BU tables.....to preserve a record of  sessions 1 and A
Use VC_VCData
Drop Table dbo.MasterProctor_BU;
Drop Table dbo.BB_ParentChild_BU;
Drop Table. dbo.BBCourses_BU;
SELECT *
INTO dbo.MasterProctor_BU
FROM dbo.MasterProctor;
SELECT *
INTO dbo.BB_ParentChild_BU
FROM dbo.BB_ParentChild;
SELECT *
INTO dbo.BBCourses_BU
FROM dbo.BBCourses;


2. Delete all records from MasterProctor and BB_ParentChild to give empty tables that will now only contain SessionB data.
3. ~/BBParentChild/UploadBB_ParentChild.aspx   to put lester's new data for session B in 
  input the data to BB_ParentCHild and Set Families  Don't forget to manually update thesessions in MasterProctor(sql on page)

.............Do this ONLY FOR SESSION B   6w2  or 8w2
	Reset the BB Data in case Wendy failed to correctly input parent/child relationships (follow directions on page)
	Then input the singletons for the session: either 1&a  or B-only
